# grunt-cli
> Grunt's command line interface.

Install this globally and you'll have access to the `grunt` command anywhere on your system.

```shell
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

**Note:** The job of the `grunt` command is to load and run the version of grunt you have installed locally to your project, irrespective of its version.  Starting with version 0.4, you should never install grunt itself globally.  For more information about why, [please read this](http://blog.nodejs.org/2011/03/23/npm-1-0-global-vs-local-installation).

See [Getting Started With Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/getting_started.md) for more information.
