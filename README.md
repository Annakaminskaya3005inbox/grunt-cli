# grunt-cli
> Grunt's command line interface.

Install this globally and you'll have access to the `grunt` command anywhere on your system.

```shell
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

_You'll still need to install grunt locally for this to do anything, but at least you won't have to type `./node_modules/.bin/grunt` all the time._

See [Getting Started With Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for more information.
